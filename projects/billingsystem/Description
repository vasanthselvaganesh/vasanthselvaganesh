Code Breakdown

Library Inclusions:

The program includes necessary headers:
#include<iostream>: This header is for input and output stream operations.
#include<stdio.h>: Although included, this header may not be necessary since iostream can handle input/output tasks in C++.

Class Definition:

A class named list is defined to represent an item in the store:
Attributes:
int id: An identifier for each item.
string name: The name of the item.
int price: The price of the item in integer format.

Display Function:

Function Signature: void display(list l[], int size, string cName, string cAddress)
This function takes an array of list objects (representing purchased items), the number of items, and customer details (name and address).
Purpose: It formats and displays the bill details, including:
Store Name
Customer Name and Address
List of items with IDs, names, and prices
Total price of all items
Implementation:
It initializes a total variable to accumulate the prices of the items.
A loop iterates through the items, printing their details and updating the total price.
Finally, it prints a thank-you message.

Main Function:

This is the entry point of the program.
User Prompts:
The program prompts the user to enter their name and address.
It also asks for the number of items they wish to purchase.
Dynamic Object Creation:
An array list l[totalItems] is created to hold details of the items.
Item Input Loop:
A loop for totalItems prompts the user for details of each item:
ID is automatically assigned based on its position.
The name and price are entered by the user.
Calling the Display Function:
After collecting all item details, the display function is called to show the formatted receipt.
Conclusion

The data.cpp program exemplifies a basic C++ application for managing simple transactions in a store, illustrating basic concepts such as class definitions, user input handling, array manipulation, and formatted output. This can serve as a foundational project for learning about object-oriented programming and basic file operations in C++.
